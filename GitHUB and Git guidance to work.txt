> cd ~/.git
b) now type
> git clone https://github.com/Rafi-Ansari/GitBash_Testing.git

the above command will copy the entire GitHub repository to your local





2) To copy a single file that is not present in your local repository, type following commands

> git fetch

b) Now type this command
> git checkout origin/master ~/.git/<selected directory path>

c) Now merge the changes
> git pull



3) If you want to upload back in GitHUB repository the file changes that you have made

a) add the file to git
> git add */single file

b) check the files ready via status
> git status

c) commit files

You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin <your-git-branch> (typically 'master', but not always)
